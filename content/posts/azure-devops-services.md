### Introduction
Wanted to share some notes I made as I have done a first look at Azure. Coming from AWS background, Azure seems like a promising platform to develop on. I wanted to share some notes from self study below:

### Azure DevOps Services:
- Is available to provide you with git repos and stuff
- Also has ActiveDirectory on git

### Azure Board
- Its like Trello or Jira for project management

### Azure Pipelines
- Is CI for build and deploy apps

### Containers on Kubernetes
- You can implement CI/CD across cloud.
- Allows 10 free parallel builds for open source projects

### Azure Source Repo:
- Lets you have private or your own git repos

### Azure Test Plans
- Capture rich data in testing your project
- End 2 end tracability

### Azure artifacts lets you share binaries
- You can add packages to any pipeline
- Review, Download, Edit files.
- You can add and manage git tags.

### Azure DevOps Services:

- Lets you manage of vms in kubernetes

### Classic Azure LaaS

- Is a series of vmâ€™s
- You can deploy AKS with Terraform
- You only pay for the nodes not the master

### Azure Storage
